## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

- I learnt how to create variables for css colors and how to call the variables.
- I learnt how to center a div by centering its parent elements

```css
:root {
    --white: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
    --Slate300: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
    --Slate500: hsl(216, 15%, 48%);
    --Slate900: hsl(218, 44%, 22%);
    --main-font: 'outfit';
}
body {
    margin: 0;
    height: 100vh;
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
}
```

### Continued development

I would continue to do more projects on FrontEnd mentor. And upskill even to Javascript and react.

### Useful resources

- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Outfit) - This helped me to add the Outfit font externally.
